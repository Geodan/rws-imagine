0	20	80	Media report that this year the electronic toll system brings in a record sum.
1	20	0	Spatial planning is realized by local initiatives. Temporarily, forces are combined when it comes to the purchase, division and planning of municipal parcels.
2	30	60	'Vehicle sharing' has grown for 12 years in a row. The exploitation of sharing cars s a commercial activity which requires a licence.                        
3	30	80	Spatial planning is based on master plans. Local procedures and rules are subordinated here. 
4	50	20	Cooperatives, with local production in 3D fab labs, make largescale production redundant.
5	50	0	The government leaves the steering instrument 'Pay-for-Mobility' to insurance companies, maintenance companies and car suppliers.
6	30	30	Mobility is expensive and the mutual willingness to pay for each other's facilities decreases. Many civilians are hit hard by this.
7	20	20	The Public Administration is changing: the central government at the bottom and the local governments and its civilians at the top.  
8	80	30	The Netherlands experiment with a participative, civil governance, supported by IT and civil servants specialized in data.
9	40	90	Research shows that the safety in road traffic has increased by communication between vehicles.
10	40	80	At harbors water drones lead the freight ships, supported by i-buyons- and cameras; this increases the cost-effectivity and the safety.
11	40	0	Local production, automatic (optimized) distribution and cheap transport (over-capacity) causes the maritime transport sector to despair.
12	40	20	The self-organizing ability of traffic has made roadside systems for dynamic traffic management redundant.
13	40	80	Cities have developed a cost-effective, centrally steered public transport network. Users of public transport often change between transport modalities.
14	60	40	The development of a legal framework for big data technology in the traffic sector (like drones and sensors) goes very slow.

18	80	80	With her first step, the Minister of Lifeability festively deploys the center course for Healthy Exercise (the Peoplemover).
19	90	50	Vehicle and environment communicate via light, an innovation coming from the US. As a result, communication has been simplified.
20	20	10	Alternative energy and the reclycing of products and materials are profitable much sooner than before. An own investment is recovered very fast.
21	20	30	Shops are enlarged show windows. Goods are delivered  the same day by couriers.
22	40	60	Energy storage via battery facilities gives technical problems again and again. Authorities are concerned about safety and environmental impact.  
23	40	50	Health care more strongly determines urban planning. A healthy person in a healthy environment.
24	40	80	In order to reduce heat stress during summer, a framework for green and urban water has been defined, which is to be executed by decentral authorities.
25	40	50	Empty office buildings are increasingly used by innovative urban farmers.
26	60	30	Cheap, locally organized energy collectives are being blocked by retail chains and traditional energy suppliers.
27	60	70	Research shows that children of low-skilled parents living in cities are relatively often suffering from respiratory problems caused by micro-dust concentrations.

29	90	70	Charging based on induction techniques is applied on a large scale in public infrastructure. 
30	80	10	After depletion of Alaska, the oil production peak is reached. Producing oil is no longer financially attractive.
31	80	50	At the (virtual) car fair, the interest in new vehicles running on hydrogen, electricity and solar energy is overwhelming.
32	60	20	The Google Driver Slots app, daily used by civilians to reserve their spot/time slot on the road network, has been downloaded for the millionth time.
33	20	30	For local design of their own living environment by civilians, the officially recognized 'Online Multi-Player Design Tool' has become available.   
34	20	100	By connecting personal transport data, the tax authorities are able to report extra revenues from road taxes.
35	10	0	The central government cannot regulate Smart Cities and Smart Mobility, by lack of knowledge or interest.. 
36	60	50	Big data and Smart City give a boost to the local city's economy as this technology facilitates individual wishes in a better way. 
37	60	30	Big projects focusing on standardization prove to be unfeasible. The need for local custom-made solutions is stronger than the demand for uniformity. 
38	80	40	The Circle, a Big Data initiative by Google focusing on computer-steered design of decentral transport management, grows in popularity.
39	90	60	'Omni-Transport Objects' become habit. These are unmanned transport objects for everyone. There are smart ways to order and pay for them.
